## Overview

![full](./full.png)
![small](./small.png)

This is the page to show the team of a project. It is a simple page with a title, a description, and a list of the team members. For this project I had a little bit of a challenge to make it look good using the grid layout. I used the grid to make the images the same way it looks on the challenge. 

For this project I also created a JSON file with the team members so I could create a team member component  and pass the info as props for the component to render. 

This project helped me understand better how grids work and how to use them to make a layout. Grids are great!
